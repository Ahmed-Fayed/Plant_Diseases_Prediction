# Plant_Diseases_Prediction
Model to predict 3 different disease

1- Corn (maize) Common rust

2 -  Potato Early blight

3- Tomato Bacterial spot

Implemented the model using 3 different methodologies:

--> First is the Subclassing Model which uses python class to build models or submodels and inherting from keras Model Module

--> Second is the Functional Model

--> Third is the Sequential Model (in master branch)
